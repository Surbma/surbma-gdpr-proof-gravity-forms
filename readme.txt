This Gravity Forms add-on is helping you to meet GDPR compliance by disabling IP address saving and it also deletes all entries after submission.

== Description ==

This Gravity Forms add-on is helping you to meet GDPR compliance by disabling IP address saving and it also deletes all entries after submission, so no personal data will be saved in the WordPress installation's database.

This plugin is a Gravity Forms add-on, so you need to buy the <a href="https://surbma.com/go/gravityforms/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a> (affiliate link) plugin first.

**IMPORTANT!** There is no settings and options for this plugin. There is no admin menu or page for this plugin. It just works! When you activate the plugin, all features will be active:
- IP Anonymization
- Entry deletion

**Disclaimer:** This plugin does not make your website nor your data management GDPR compliant. It is helping you to comply with GDPR, by not saving any submitted data in the WordPress database. However you can still control the submitted data to be sent to any third party services or to any email address. It is your duty to manage and control all submitted personal data to be compliant with GDPR.

**IP Anonymization:** This plugin is disabling IP address saving, so no visitor IP will be saved.

**Remove form entries:** If you enable this plugin, all new entries will be deleted immediately after the form submission. So there will be no entries stored in the WordPress database. Submitted data can be sent by email or can be intergrated with third party services, like CRM, help desk, newsletter and other services.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it really GDPR compatible? =

This plugin shows a simple popup for every new visitors with two options: accept or decline the Google Analytics tracking. If the visitor declines tracking, Google Analytics tracking code won't show up in the HTML. This plugin gives you all the tools to make your Google Analytics tracking GDPR proof, but it is your responsibility to use it the right way.

= What does Surbma mean? =

It is the reverse version of my last name. ;)
